    <string name="tutorial">Welcome to Golf Shot Rating.
This app will rate your shots and also enable you to enter leagues where you can compete against your friends or other golfers anywhere in the
        world. In these leagues you can compete in areas such as Driving, Long Game (250 - 100 yards from the pin), short game (100 yards and
        in) and putting.
When you start up the app you are presented with a screen with options to login (if you have already registered),
Register, Continue as a guest or view the Tutorial.
The Login and register buttons are as you would expect. The Continue as Guest button allows you to use the app to rate your shots and it
        will store your rounds on the phone but you will not be able to export your rounds or participate in any leagues.
Once you login or Continue as Guest you will come to a screen with Options of: List of rounds (here you can review the rounds you have
        saved on the phone), New Round (here you will play your round of golf), Leagues (here you can see what leagues you are in and
        create or enter other leagues), and Logout.
When you select the New Round option you are brought to a screen where courses near you will be displayed. You select the course you are
        playing and then select your handicap and finally press the Continue button.
You will now be brought to the main shot input screen. Until the phone gets an good GPS accuracy the buttons will be disabled and the GPS
        icon will be red. When a good GPS signal is received the GPS icon will turn green and all buttons will be enabled. To input your
        shots you need to press a button that represents where you are hitting your shot from. EG on the tee box you select either
        TEE SHOT DRIVER or TEE SHOT IRON. If your tee shot lands in a bunker you go to your ball and then press BUNKER.
        If this shot lands on the fairway you go to your ball and press FAIRWAY. When you are on the green you press the ON GREEN button.
        This does not enter a shot but takes you to a screen with a large image of a golf green on it. To enter a putt you simple swipe
        across the screen and the device will record your putt (the device will vibrate to let you know it has recorded the shot).
        The reason for this input method is that golfers preferred not to have to take their phones out and click a button while on
        the putting green as it slowed play, they prefer to put the phone in their back pocket and simple swipe their thumb across
        the screen when over their golf ball. You do this for each putt and when you sink the last putt you finally need to record
        the location of the pin. You do this by standing beside the pin and pressing the FLAG image in the upper right corner of the screen.
        You will then be taken to a screen with a summary of how you did on that hole (you can rotate this summary screen and it will
        bring up a summary of each hole you have played). When you have finished the round you will be taken to a screen with a summary
        of your round.

    <string name="mappingText">The course you have selected has not had the greens tagged.
        This means that you will not get the distance to the center of the green for each hole. All other functionality
        is still there.
    You now have the option of tagging the greens or not. The greens only need to be tagged once
        and then, when you or any other golfer play this course they will be able to get accurate distances to the
    center of the green. To tag the greens you simply need to click on, \'I will tag the greens\' button below.
        If you do this an icon will appear in the top right corner of the screen when you are on the green.
    You simply need to click this icon when you are in the CENTER of the green and that green is tagged.
    If you are tagging greens you can still record putts on the green and input the location of the flag as normal.
        You can tag the center of the green when before you putt or betwenn putts but if you are tagging the
        center of the green you must do it before you click on the \'flag\' icon as this ends the hole.
    If you do not wish to tag the greens then simply click on, \'I do not want to tag the greens\' and you
        can play your round as normal.</string>
